# WinPick Web Application Changes

## Fixed Issues

### 1. GitHub Downloader Error
Fixed the TypeError in GitHubDownloader initialization by creating a web-friendly version of the downloader that doesn't require Tkinter dependencies.

#### Changes Made:
- Created a new `GitHubDownloaderWeb` class without Tkinter dependencies
- Updated `GitHubController` to use the new web-friendly downloader
- Enhanced the download process to properly handle repository prefixes

### 2. Missing get_username Method Error
Fixed the AttributeError for missing get_username method in GitHubAuthHandler by creating a web-friendly version of the authentication handler.

#### Changes Made:
- Created a new `GitHubAuthHandlerWeb` class with a `get_username` method
- Removed Tkinter dependencies from the authentication process
- Simplified the device flow authentication for web use

### 3. Rating System Tkinter Dependency
Fixed the dependency on Tkinter in the rating system for the web application.

#### Changes Made:
- Created a new `RatingSystemWeb` class without Tkinter dependencies
- Removed UI-specific dialog methods
- Maintained the same GitHub Issues-based rating functionality
- Updated references in app.py to use the web-friendly classes

### 4. Missing Context Variables
Fixed missing context variables in template rendering for various routes.

#### Changes Made:
- Added `github_status` and `now` variables to all template rendering contexts
- Ensured consistent availability of these variables across all routes

4. Complete the GitHub authentication process
5. Verify that your GitHub username appears in the navigation bar

### Testing GitHub Downloads

2. Enter a valid GitHub repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/itsmikethetech/WinPick-Scripts)
3. Select a category and click Download
4. Verify that scripts are downloaded correctly
5. Check that repository-prefixed filenames are created for non-default repositories

### Testing Script Creation
1. Navigate to the New Script page
2. Create a new script with all required fields
3. Verify that the script is created and displayed correctly in the selected category

## Notes
- The web application handles GitHub interactions differently than the Tkinter version:
  - No interactive dialogs for confirmation prompts
  - Repository prefix is added automatically for non-default repositories
  - Console output is captured and displayed on the web UI
  - Authentication is handled through the GitHub Device Flow
  - Rating information is still stored in GitHub Issues
